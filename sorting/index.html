            <h2>Importance of Sorting</h2>
            <p>
                Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is essential for organizing data efficiently.
                It helps in searching, data analysis, and ensures better performance in data retrieval. Most real-life
                scenarios, such as arranging books in a library or sorting entries in an online store, use some form of sorting.

            <h3>Real-Life Example of Sorting</h3>
            <p>
                One real-life example of sorting is **organizing books in a library** by their titles or authors.
                By sorting them, you can find a specific book quickly. In an online store, sorting product listings by price, ratings,
                or popularity makes the browsing experience faster and more user-friendly.
