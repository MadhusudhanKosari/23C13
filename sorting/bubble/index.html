            <h2>Importance of Bubble Sort</h2>
            <p>
                Bubble Sort is a simple and easy-to-understand sorting algorithm often used in educational contexts. 
                It's particularly useful for understanding the basics of sorting algorithms. Although inefficient for large datasets, 
                it can be useful for small or nearly sorted data.

            <h2>When to Use Bubble Sort</h2>
            <p>
                Bubble Sort should be used when you have a small dataset or when the dataset is nearly sorted. 
                It is inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n²) time complexity.

            <h2>Real-Life Example</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine a teacher arranging students based on their height in ascending order. 
                The teacher starts from the leftmost student and compares adjacent students, swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
                The teacher continues this process until all students are in the correct order.
