            <h2>Importance of Insertion Sort</h2>
            <p>
                Insertion Sort is an efficient algorithm for small datasets. It is a stable sorting technique 
                and works well for nearly sorted data, making it a great option for simple use cases. Its easy-to-understand nature makes it a commonly used sorting method in various applications.

            <h2>When to Use Insertion Sort</h2>
            <p>
                Insertion Sort is best used when the dataset is small or mostly sorted. Its performance can degrade for large datasets, 
                but it excels when sorting real-time incoming data like sorting cards in hand.

            <h2>Real-Life Example</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine arranging playing cards in your hand. You start by picking up the first card and then, 
                one by one, you insert the next card into its correct position among the already sorted cards. This is exactly how Insertion Sort works.

                        int j = i - 1;
                        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
                            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
